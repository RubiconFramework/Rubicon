# Rubicon Engine (WIP)

A Friday Night Funkin' engine built for easy use for developers, especially with the use of Godot Engine!

This engine is designed to be as robust as possible while still keeping it as non-complicated as possible towards developers looking forward to using this engine.

# Status

This engine is in a very Work-In-Progress state at the moment, so not everything may be functional. The moment we feel like this engine is stable enough to be used in actual fan games is when we will remove the W.I.P and bump up the version to v1.0.

# Developing on Rubicon

### Prerequisites

Please make sure you have the following on your device:

- [Godot Engine v4.3 with .NET support](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.3-stable/) (Other versions not guaranteed to work)
- [.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [rcedit](https://github.com/electron/rcedit) (Windows exclusive, required for Windows exporting)

If you're developing on Rubicon, whether it's contributing to the engine or making your own fan-game, you should be aware that the way this engine handles tasks is nothing like how most other Friday Night Funkin' engines handle them, if the switch to Godot wasn't enough of an indicator. 

We plan to have an API Reference and a wiki to help developers better understand the engine more easily, so please bear with us! :pray:

### Recommended IDEs

We recommend using an IDE that has intelligent code completion, syntax highlighting, and integrates closely with Godot. Some that come to mind are [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [C#](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) and [C# Tools for Godot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=neikeq.godot-csharp-vscode) plugins installed.

[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) is also a good choice, but that's for Windows only.

### Languages

This engine uses mainly C# for its code base and main scripting.

Lua is not planned to be supported in this engine any time soon. However GDScript is, but will most likely be a little finicky to work with by nature since this is essentially cross-language scripting. 

You could possibly work with GDExtension, though we won't provide any support for those ourselves. (Theoretically you could use Haxe! We wouldn't recommend it though, C# is very similar, if not better functionally than it.)

### Disclaimer

We ask you that you please follow proper C# formatting when developing with us, like for example: PascalCase names for public and protected properties, and _camelCase for private properties (with the underscore).

# Contributing

We would appreciate your guys' help so much! The main way to help us out would be to submit issues or pull requests. It would be a struggle if everyone split off to make their own version of Rubicon when we could all benefit from it!
